In the reading passage, some measures have been advised to prevent
Australia from being occupied by the cane toad. The professor, 
however, points out that these measures are not only useless but
have the possibility to make matters even worse.

Firstly, a natural fence seems to be effective to clog the spread
of the cane toad physically, according to the reading passage.
However, the lecture challenges this idea, and points out that there
are always rivers or lakes, which may do a favor for the cane toad by
carrying them across the fence. Thus, the idea turns out to be of
no efficiency.

Secondly, the passage points out that the toads can be captured and 
devastated by volunteers, as young toads and their eggs are easy to be caught. 
However, even though it may help to control the extending of the toad 
population, untrained volunteers might simultaneously destroy some native 
frogs as well, many of which are endangered.

Finally, it is can be totally a disaster if a specific virus is used to 
provoke the shrivel of the cane toad populations. The virus has the capability to 
greatly affect the eco-system of Australia and even the world when the infected
toads are delivered to other continents, for example, South America. Native toads in 
South America is in risk when the lethal toads are transported from Australia,as 
the native species of toad and reptiles are part of the local ecosystem. 
As a result, it will significantly damage the local environment.
