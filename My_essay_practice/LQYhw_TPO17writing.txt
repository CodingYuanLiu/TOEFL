    In the reading passage, the writer claims that the incessant growth of human population and the corresponding increase in agriculture and pesticide use have resulted in much harm to wildlife in the United States, birds in particular. The speaker, however, contradicts this view for the following 3 reasons.
    Firstly, it is true that the growing population of humanity will cause the expansion of urban areas, which however, is not likely to harm bird species. Although some kinds of bird may be affected, others are provided with better habitats. Seagulls and pigeons, or even hawks, for example, can be seen continually by citizens due to the favorable environment. The population of these species are expected to ascend, rather than descend.
    Secondly, the increasing of agriculture does not mean the plunder of birds' habitat. The truth is, with the rapid development of prolific crops, less and less land is being used for agriculture every year. As a result, there's no need to destroy birds' hometown anymore.
    Finally, though traditional pasticides have been deadly for birds in the past, this will never happen since we aware of the danger. Nowadays, pasticides with little toxicity are invented and wildly used, which dramatically reduce the hazard. What's more, the crops are genetically designed to resist pests without pasticides, and these crops are nonpoisonous to birds.
